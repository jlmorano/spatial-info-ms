The EUPSFS index was linked to the PS EU FSC 91 season 1 where much of the catch comes from. Indices were input as annual indices, except the BAI index that maintained their seasonal information, with a mean CV=0.2 for the LL indices and 0.3 for the BAI and EUPSFS indices but allowed to vary with the interannual variability in the estimated standard error of the index.",Yellowfin tuna - Atlantic,Yellowfin tuna , Atlantic,2019,10,Primary
